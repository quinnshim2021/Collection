# Quinn's Collection

This project takes advantage of the (relatively) new tool, PolyCam. Using this app, I am creating 3D models of my different collectables to be displayed on this site. 

## Link to PolyCam

https://poly.cam/

## Currently local

All .glb files are local and site runs on localhost. Working on getting those changed.


## Improvements to Make

- adding more items
- improve loading performance
- move data to MongoDB and pull at runtime
- paginate renders so I do not have to wait for all of them to load at once
